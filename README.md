# JJMNET: Neural Network from Scratch ðŸ§   

This repository contains a self-made neural network implementation written in Python. The network supports forward propagation, backpropagation, and training using gradient descent. It was written as a fun side project to grow in ML/AI knowledge by myself, John M. you can test it with the sample dataset provided in the main.py file, or follow the later instructions to test it with your own data.

## Features  
âœ… Custom-built neural network (no external ML libraries) supporting a variety of combinations of input and output features and 
activation functions, with additional supports on the way)  
âœ… Supports multiple layers and activation functions (sigmoid, RELu)
âœ… Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and backpropagation for training via the chain rule
âœ… Works with various datasets  

## Getting Started  

### Installation  
Clone the repository:  
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Johnmllr-design/Neural-Network.git]
